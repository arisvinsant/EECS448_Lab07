I found the following bugs using my test suite:

1. isEmpty() always will return true even if the list is not empty. This bug caused many of the other methods that rely on it to have problems as well.

2. size() did not properly adjust when items were added to the front or the back of the list. This is probably a result of the isEmpty() bug as well.

3. addBack() did not actually add values to the back of the list.
